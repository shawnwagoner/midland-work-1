            <p>The BCA Pool League is an umbrella membership organization that allows pool leagues around the world to "Be Part of Something Bigger." A single local league, even one with hundreds of members, is limited in what it can offer its members. However, when hundreds or thousands of leagues around the world band together under the BCA Pool League umbrella, the economy of scale provides all leagues value and benefits that they could not achieve alone.

            <p>American Poolplayers Association (APA) was founded by professional poolplayers and Billiard Hall of Famers Terry Bell and Larry Hubbart in 1979 as the National Pool League, which became the American Poolplayers Association in 1981. The two realized the popularity of the sport, but knew, that different from other sports, there was no existing recreational league system.></p>
